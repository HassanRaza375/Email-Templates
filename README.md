**Why Use Table Structures in Email Templates?**
**Consistency:**
 Many email clients, especially legacy ones or those with strict rendering engines (like some versions of Outlook), do not support modern layout techniques (such as flexbox or CSS grid). Tables provide a predictable, grid-like structure that ensures your content is displayed consistently.
**Cross-Client Compatibility:**
 Tables are widely supported in most email clients (Gmail, Yahoo, Hostinger, etc.), making them the safest choice for complex layouts.
**Fallback Simplicity:**
When CSS support is minimal or stripped out, the table structure itself still organizes your content in a usable way.


**Compatibility Considerations**
**Gmail:**

Supports inline CSS well, but may ignore embedded styles in the <head>.
Strips out certain styles (like external fonts or some CSS properties) so keep the design simple.
**Yahoo:**

Similar to Gmail, prioritize inline CSS.
Make sure to test interactive elements and layout in Yahooâ€™s email client.
**Hostinger Email Client:**

If using a host-specific client (like those provided by Hostinger), ensure that the layout renders correctly on both web and mobile versions.
Test with their email service documentation if available.
Other Clients (e.g., Outlook):

Outlook may use the Microsoft Word rendering engine, which can lead to inconsistent behavior.
Avoid complex CSS and consider using conditional comments to target specific versions of Outlook if necessary.
